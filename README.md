# Dynmap Scraper
A set of scripts that will download images that are inside a user-defined area from a Dynmap server.

The purpose is for this script to run on a schedule, effectively creating many snapshots of the state of a world. The snapshots can be used to create a visual high-definition timelapse of the evolution of a server. The only limits are your hard-drive space.

### TODO:
* Create `.zip` file of downloaded contents
* Upload `.zip` file to cloud hosting
